Streamlit Application README
Overview
This repository contains a Streamlit app. Streamlit is an open-source framework to create data apps in Python with minimal effort. This app allows users to interact with data or visualizations through a web interface.

Requirements
To run this application, you will need to have the following software installed:

Python 3.x

Streamlit (of course!)

Any other dependencies required by the app (these will typically be listed in requirements.txt or specified in the app itself)

Setting Up
Follow these steps to get the app running locally:

1. Clone the Repository
bash
Copy
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/your-repository.git
cd your-repository
2. Install Dependencies
It’s recommended to use a virtual environment, but this step is optional. If you want to use venv, here's how:

bash
Copy
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate   # On Windows use `venv\Scripts\activate`
Then install the dependencies:

bash
Copy
pip install -r requirements.txt
Make sure you have Streamlit installed. If not, install it manually:

bash
Copy
pip install streamlit
If there’s a requirements.txt, it will include all necessary dependencies for the app.

3. Run the Streamlit App
Once everything is set up, run the app with:

bash
Copy
streamlit run your_app.py
This will start a development server, and you can view the app by navigating to:

http://localhost:8501 in your web browser.

4. (Optional) Modify the App
If you want to modify the app, just open the your_app.py file and edit it. The Streamlit app will automatically update in the browser when you save the changes.

5. Deploying the App (Optional)
If you want to deploy your app to the web, consider using platforms like:

Streamlit Cloud

Heroku

AWS

Google Cloud

Azure

Follow the platform-specific instructions for deploying your app.

Troubleshooting
Error: "Streamlit is not recognized as a command": Make sure Streamlit is installed by running pip install streamlit.

Error: "Port 8501 is already in use": Streamlit may not shut down properly. Either restart your computer or run the app on a different port by running:

bash
Copy
streamlit run your_app.py --server.port=8502
